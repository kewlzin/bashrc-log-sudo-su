# bashrc-log-sudo-su
bash script for .bashrc to record sudo su commands


Add this to you /root/.bashrc (sudo su ~/.bashrc) to record sudo su commands with the info on the user that has logged in as root (and ip if it is a ssh connection)

If you have an external log server, make sure you send local1 logs to it
